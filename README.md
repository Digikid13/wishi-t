You need node and grunt installed

run `grunt serve`

The main files you want to look at are:

client/app/main.controller.js
          /main.css
          /main.html
server/api/page/index.js
               /page.controller.js

If you want to see the json that is retreived in text format go to: http://localhost:9000/api/page?p=2
Where p is the page number.
